Cap18 is a program developed by TxDOT to analyze bridge bent caps. The program utilizes a discrete element model that produces  envelopes of maximum bending and shear forces acting on bridge bent caps. Analytical  results are for working stress and/or load factor design in accordance with the AASHTO LRFD  Bridge Design Specifications or the AASHTO Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges.  User input live loads are automatically placed within user defined lanes to generate maximum  forces at user specified points. A table of maximum reactions of each beam/girder/stringer  with concomitant reactions at all other beam/girder/stringers is optionally reported.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"#Cap18.DLResult","page":"Home","title":"Cap18.DLResult","text":"struct DLResult\n\nA result from the Table4A table (just one entry).\n\nFields\n\nsta::Int -  station along bent\ndist::Float64 - actual distance along bent\ndefl::Float64 - deflection of bent at station\nmoment::Float64 - moment of bent at station\nshear::Float64 - sheat of bent at station\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#Cap18.Table4A","page":"Home","title":"Cap18.Table4A","text":"struct Table4A\n\nTable4A of the Cap18 analysis results.\n\nFields\n\nresults::Vector{DLResult} -  collection of the dead load results from Table4A\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"}]
