However, there are many inputs to the program, and it is important to list out all of them in order to determine the amount of options available.\nThe Cap18 program allows the user to provide a number of different inputs. These inputs are provided to the program through a “*.dat” file. This input file is simply a text file that the program can parse and then execute. The file has a specific format that is separated by different “cards”. There are 4 different types of cards.\nThe specific order of these cards allows the program to know the current card as it steps through each line. Each card is a single line in the input file that contains multiple inputs the program can read. The multiple inputs are separated by the position on the line (ie the first input will be a certain range of characters in the beginning of the line). An input does not have to fill the entire range of characters for that specific input. This range allowance for each input will not be checked directly. Although with the different bents, there will be enough disparity among the inputs to that some level of checking will be done indirectly. A summary of the cards and their list of inputs will now be discussed in more detail to determine the brevity of the check that is needed.",

HDR uses this software heavily in the bent design process, so validation of this tool is necessary. Since there is no access to the underlying code, validation must be approached differently compared to internal tools. This document will attempt to provide an outline for the process of validating the Cap18 program.",

    "section": "1.1 Cap18 Inputs",
    "text": "1.1 Cap18 Inputs\nThis next section will get into the details of what the Cap18 program is. It will try to stay concise. However, there are many inputs to the program, and it is important to list out all of them in order to determine the amount of options available.\nThe Cap18 program allows the user to provide a number of different inputs. These inputs are provided to the program through a “*.dat” file. This input file is simply a text file that the program can parse and then execute. The file has a specific format that is separated by different “cards”. There are 4 different types of cards.\n\nComment Cards\nHeader Cards\nProblem Cards\nTable Cards\n\nThe specific order of these cards allows the program to know the current card as it steps through each line. Each card is a single line in the input file that contains multiple inputs the program can read. The multiple inputs are separated by the position on the line (ie the first input will be a certain range of characters in the beginning of the line). An input does not have to fill the entire range of characters for that specific input. This range allowance for each input will not be checked directly. Although with the different bents, there will be enough disparity among the inputs to that some level of checking will be done indirectly. A summary of the cards and their list of inputs will now be discussed in more detail to determine the brevity of the check that is needed.\n\n1.1.1 Comment Cards\nComment cards begin with a dollar sign ($) and these lines are for the users own documentation purposes. These cards are ignored by the Cap18 program. No checking is needed here.\n\n\n1.1.2 Header Cards\nHeader cards are sort of comment cards, but the Cap18 program needs them to run. These cards only contain general project information that does not affect the results. The same headers will be provided to each run. No checking is needed here.\n\n\n1.1.3 Problem Cards\nProblem cards contain 3 inputs.\n\nProblem number\nUnit Code\nDescription From the problem card inputs, unit code is the only one that will affect results. However only the US Customary unit code will be checked.\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Table Cards\n\n1.1.4.1 Table 1\nTable 1 card contains 9 inputs.\n\nPrint stringer reaction report\nKeep Envelopes from prior problem\nKeep prior Table 2\nKeep prior Table 3\nKeep prior Table 4\nNumber of cards for Table 4\nKeep envelopes from random lane\nPrint options\nSkew angle\n\n\n\n1.1.4.2 Table 2\nTable 2 has two cards Table2a and Table 2b.\nTable 2a has 9 inputs.\n\nnumber of slab increments\nincrement length\nnumber of total moving increments\nstart station of moving load\nend station of moving load\nstep size of moving increments\nanalysis option\ndead load factor\nlive load factor\n\nTable 2b has 7 inputs.\n\noverlay factor\nmax lanes loaded\nmultiple presence factor for 1 lane\nmultiple presence factor for 2 lanes\nmultiple presence factor for 3 lanes\nmultiple presence factor for 4 lanes\nmultiple presence factor for 5 lanes\n\n\n\n1.1.4.3 Table 3\nTable 3 has a varied number of inputs depending on the problem. However, they can be classified into 11 different inputs\n\nnumber of lanes\nnumber of stringers\nnumber of supports\nnumber of moment points\nstation at left lane\nstations at right lane\nstation at stringers\nstation at supports\nstation at moment points\nstation at shear points\n\n\n\n1.1.4.4 Table 4\nTable 4 has a varied number of inputs, and they can be classified into 8 different inputs.\n\nstation from\nstation to\ncont’d\nbending stiffness of cap\nslab and sidewalk loads\ncap and stringer loads\nmoving loads\noverlay loads\n\nTo validate Cap18, the program will be run for two different bent configurations. These results will then be compared against one of HDRs validated software programs, LARSA. The different bent configurations will be discussed below. At the end, a summary of the different bent configurations and their inputs into the cap18 program will be shown. The goal is for each input into the Cap18 program to at least have 1 different value across all the different configurations.",

When an “X” is not present, a comment is added to explain the reason why there were not different inputs provided between the two example problems.\nSome inputs were not checked in the cap18 program.

    "text": "2.2 Summary of the Results\nThe Cap18 program was found to adequatley model the two example problems. The results between the two programs was found to be very similar. Most of the differences in the stresses found were due to the way cap18 modeled the point loads compared to how the point loads were defined in the larsa model. The point loads were modeled in larsa as true point loads, while cap18 provided a more realistic load that was spread out to reflect the bottom of a beam. The other discrepency was due to the limitation in how the live load was defined in larsa. Since, the larsa model was treating the live load as a truck or trucks moving along a span (instead of a transverse movement within defined lanes), there were no lane definitions to keep trucks within their respective lanes. The trucks were allowed to move “as one” with no gap in between them. Larsa also did not seem to capture different maximum values when spanmarks were added. This is probably due to the live load being on the slab elements when the cap elements needed to be maximized. While these differences could be seen between the two models, the results were still relatively close, and when there were greater discrepencies, cap18 had the higher stresses.",

    "text": "3.4 Comparison\nBelow is a comparison of the Cap18 and Larsa results. Stresses were found to be fairly similar between the different programs. The main differences are in the shear stresses. Cap18 seems to have a more gradual change in shear compared to Larsa. This is most likely due to the way Cap18 defines the point loads in the program. This gradual vs more sharp change in shear does not seem to affect the moment diagram in a significant way. Moment diagram stresses do show some differences and will be discussed in more detail below.\nImportant Plot Information\nThe comparison plots for the shear and moment diagrams are shown below for all the different load cases. The Cap18 results are shown in a blue line and the larsa results are shown in a red line. The red line will only really be visible when the larsa results are greater in magnitude than the cap18 results. The thickness of the red or blue line shows how much greater in magnitdue the respective result was. The absolute difference between larsa and cap18 is show in yellow. Any positive yellow results indicate that larsa was greater in magnitude. Data labels are also visible for the moment diagrams at the local extrema. Text in blue indicates that Cap18 was greater in magnitude, while red text indicates larsa results were greater in magnitude.\n\n\n3.4.1 SRV\n\n3.4.1.1 Dead Load Results (SRV)\nThe figures below compare the DL results between the two programs.

    "text": "4.4 Comparison\nBelow is a comparison of the Cap18 and Larsa results. Stresses were found to be fairly similar between the different programs. The main differences are in the shear stresses. Cap18 seems to have a more gradual change in shear compared to Larsa. This is most likely due to the way Cap18 defines the point loads in the program. This gradual vs more sharp change in shear does not seem to affect the moment diagram in a significant way. Moment diagram stresses do show some differences and will be discussed in more detail below.\nImportant Plot Information\nThe comparison plots for the shear and moment diagrams are shown below for all the different load cases. The Cap18 results are shown in a blue line and the larsa results are shown in a red line. The red line will only really be visible when the larsa results are greater in magnitude than the cap18 results. The thickness of the red or blue line shows how much greater in magnitdue the respective result was. The absolute difference between larsa and cap18 is show in yellow. Any positive yellow results indicate that larsa was greater in magnitude. Data labels are also visible for the moment diagrams at the local extrema. Text in blue indicates that Cap18 was greater in magnitude, while red text indicates larsa results were greater in magnitude.\n\n\n4.4.1 SRV\n\n4.4.1.1 Dead Load Results (SRV)\nThe figures below compare the DL results between the two programs. The areas in red highlight where larsa results were greater in magnitude than the cap18 results. There are some visible red areas in the shear diagram. However, these can be explained by the difference in point load modeling between the two programs. The maximum values are shown to be very similar. In areas of maximum moment and shears, the results are within 3%.\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\nFigure 4.15: Comparison: DL Shear and Moment Diagrams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\nFigure 4.16: Comparison: DL Shear and Moment Difference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4.1.2 Envelopes of Maximum Values (SRV)\n\n4.4.1.2.1 Maximum Envelope Comparison\nThe figures below compare the working stress results for the maximum stress envelope between the two programs.

The areas in red highlight where larsa results were greater in magnitude than the cap18 results. There are some visible red areas in the shear diagram. However, some of the differences can be explained by the difference in point load modeling between the two programs. The other shear areas where larsa results look to be higher in magnitude could potentially be explained by the difference in how the programs run the live load. The Larsa modeling of the live load is a little limited and conservative methods were used.\nThe maximum moment values are shown to be very similar. In areas of maximum moment, the results are within 3%.\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\nFigure 4.21: Comparison: Service Shear and Moment Max LL Envelope Diagrams\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figures below compare the working stress results for the minimum stress envelope of the live load between the two programs.

However, these can be explained by the difference in point load modeling between the two programs. There are also large red spikes in the shear diagram for the larsa results. This is also a sign there are some unrealistic modeling behaviors in the larsa model.\nThe maximum moment values are shown to be very similar.

In areas of maximum moment, the results are greater at 11%. However, with the limitations of the larsa model, this is not alarming.
