\section{Example 2 - Six Column Bent (Back
Span)}\label{example-2---six-column-bent-back-span}

Example 2 was run for both Larsa and Cap18. Example 2 needed two
separate runs to effectively analyze for the backspan and the forward
span. This is the analysis of the back span part of the example. Below
is a short summary of the bent details.

Bent Details:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  9 Tx54 backspan girders
\item
  10 Tx54 forwardspan girders
\item
  78' wide bent
\item
  6 columns spaced at 14'
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Back Span}\label{back-span}

The figure below shows the beam spacing for the backspan girders. Since
Cap18 works in half-foot increments, the beam spacing was rounded to the
nearest increments. Both Cap18 and Larsa have the same spacing for the
beams.

\subsection{Forward Span}\label{forward-span}

The figure below shows the beam spacing for the forwardspan girders.

\section{Cap 18}\label{cap-18}

A Cap18 input file was created and ran for the above bent. The output
file was then parsed for the dead load, working stress, and load factor
cases. The summary of the findings are discussed below.

\subsection{SRV}\label{srv}

\subsubsection{Dead Load Results (SRV)}\label{dead-load-results-srv}

The dead load results were plotted on top of the bent to get a better
visual understanding of the results. Based on the DL shear and moment
diagrams below, the Cap18 results look to align well with the bent.
Sharp changes in shear happen in areas with either a column or a beam,
and negative moments are maximized over the columns. This indicates to
some degree that the expected behavior of the stresses within the cap is
being captured by the Cap18 program. A more detailed comparison with
Larsa results will help determine if the magnitudes of these stresses
are correct.

\subsubsection{Envelopes of Maximum Values

better visual understanding of the results. The results can be seen in
the figures below. These stresses follow the same expected behavoir as
the DL stresses. Further comparison with Larsa is needed.

visual understanding of the results. The results can be seen in the

\section{Larsa Results}\label{larsa-results}

A Larsa model was created and ran for the above bent. The loads were
extracted for the dead load, working stress, and load factor cases. The
summary of the findings are discussed below.

\subsection{SRV}\label{srv-1}

\subsubsection{Dead Load Results (SRV)}\label{dead-load-results-srv-1}

The dead load results were plotted on top of the bent to get a better
visual understanding of the results. Based on the DL shear and moment

\section{Comparison}\label{comparison}

Below is a comparison of the Cap18 and Larsa results. Stresses were
found to be fairly similar between the different programs. The main
differences are in the shear stresses. Cap18 seems to have a more
gradual change in shear compared to Larsa. This is most likely due to
the way Cap18 defines the point loads in the program. This gradual vs
more sharp change in shear does not seem to affect the moment diagram in
a significant way. Moment diagram stresses do show some differences and
will be discussed in more detail below.

\textbf{Important Plot Information}\\
The comparison plots for the shear and moment diagrams are shown below
for all the different load cases. The Cap18 results are shown in a blue
line and the larsa results are shown in a red line. The red line will
only really be visible when the larsa results are greater in magnitude
than the cap18 results. The thickness of the red or blue line shows how
much greater in magnitdue the respective result was. The absolute
difference between larsa and cap18 is show in yellow. Any positive
yellow results indicate that larsa was greater in magnitude. Data labels
are also visible for the moment diagrams at the local extrema. Text in
blue indicates that Cap18 was greater in magnitude, while red text
indicates larsa results were greater in magnitude.

\subsection{SRV}\label{srv-2}

\subsubsection{Dead Load Results (SRV)}\label{dead-load-results-srv-2}

The figures below compare the DL results between the two programs. The
areas in red highlight where larsa results were greater in magnitude
than the cap18 results. There are some visible red areas in the shear
diagram. However, these can be explained by the difference in point load
modeling between the two programs. The maximum values are shown to be
very similar. In areas of maximum moment and shears, the results are
within 3\%.

modeling between the two programs. . In areas of maximum moment and
shears, the results are within 4\%.

\subsubsection{Live Load Comparison
(SRV)}\label{live-load-comparison-srv}

The figures below compare the working stress results for the maximum
stress envelope of the live load between the two programs. The areas in
red highlight where larsa results were greater in magnitude than the
cap18 results. There are some visible red areas in the shear diagram.
However, some of the differences can be explained by the difference in
point load modeling between the two programs. The other shear areas
where larsa results look to be higher in magnitude could potentially be
explained by the difference in how the programs run the live load. The
Larsa modeling of the live load is a little limited and conservative
methods were used.

The maximum moment values are shown to be very similar. In areas of
maximum moment, the results are within 3\%.

in magnitude than the cap18 results. There are some visible red areas in
the shear diagram. However, these can be explained by the difference in
point load modeling between the two programs. There are also large red
spikes in the shear diagram for the larsa results. This is also a sign
there are some unrealistic modeling behaviors in the larsa model.

The maximum moment values are shown to be very similar. In areas of
maximum moment, the results are within 5\%.

magnitude than the cap18 results. There are some visible red areas in
the shear diagram. However, these can be explained by the difference in
point load modeling between the two programs. There are also large red
spikes in the shear diagram for the larsa results. This is also a sign
there are some unrealistic modeling behaviors in the larsa model.

The maximum moment values are shown to be very similar. In areas of
maximum moment, the results are greater at 11\%. However, with the
limitations of the larsa model, this is not alarming. Cap18 results are
higher and the program is doing a better job at maximizing the
controlling areas.

(STR)}\label{maximum-support-reactions-str-2}

The figure below compares the load factor results for the maximum and
minimum reactions between the two programs. The results between programs
are within 5\% of eachother.
